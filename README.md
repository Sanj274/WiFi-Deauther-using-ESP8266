# Wi-Fi Deauther using ESP8266

This project demonstrates a deauthentication attack on Wi-Fi networks using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It exploits the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol’s vulnerability by sending forged deauthentication frames, forcibly disconnecting devices from the target network.

## Features

- Scan and list nearby Wi-Fi access points
- Select target devices
- Launch deauth and beacon frame attacks
- Web interface for control and monitoring
- Validated using Wireshark

## Tools & Technologies

- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Arduino IDE
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Web UI)
- Wireshark (for traffic analysis)
